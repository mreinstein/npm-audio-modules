## npm-audio-modules

my personal notes on the minefield that is audio modules in npm/javascript.


### node microphone modules
`mic`, `node-microphone`, and `node-record-lpcm16` are very similar in that they wrap `sox`, or `arecord`, or `alsa`
and provide a standard node stream.

`microphone` is a wrapper around ALSA and provides mp3 encoding.
I couldn't get it to work at all. seems broken.


### browser microphone modules

`microphone-stream` provides a node compatible stream from a `getUserMedia()` object.
It's nice being able to use node streams in the browser, but it also makes your front end bundle
pretty huge because shimming node modules for the front end results in a big size increase.

`wave-recorder` is a similar module. Also expose node style streams, which have the same pros/cons
as `microphone-stream`


### processing modules

The web Audio API is not available natively in node. There's a lot of javascript out in
the wild based on this API, which would be really nice to be able to use in node.

`audio-analyser` is an awesome module that bridges this gap. It provides a writable node 
stream. You pipe microphone data in, and then can access the web audio API.

https://github.com/shubhamjain/whistlerr is not an npm module, but it provides a way
to take an audio input from the browser and detect when whistles occur.

my fork, which exposes a node module for this: https://github.com/mreinstein/node-whistlerr


### rendering modules

`audio-render` renders audio waveforms, and it works in both node and browser environments.
Though I find the browser version is too bloated due to reliance on shimmed node modules.

`audio-waveform` is another waveform renderer that works in the browser and node.
It uses node-style streams, so to use this in the browser you need something like 
`microphone-stream` or `wave-recorder` to provide streamable microphone data.
It's a little hard to use because the examples aren't helpful, but I'm hoping they accept 
my PR which provides node and browser usage examples.

`wavearea` provides a waveform renderer, but it also provides simple cut/copy/paste edit
controls! The current code has a few bugs that prevent it from being used. Still 
waiting for them to accept my pull requests to fix this.
